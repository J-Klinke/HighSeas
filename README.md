My first 'big' project: a 'battleship' style game

In version 1.1 the game has three map sizes and a computer opponent.
However, there is only one difficulty, which makes the oppenent to move randomly, but no move will be made twice.

Version 1.2 is in progress, it will implement a second difficulty and cosmetic improvements
