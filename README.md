My first 'big' project: a text-based 'battleship' style game

In version 1.1 the game has three map sizes and a computer opponent.
However, there is only one difficulty, which makes the oppenent move randomly, but no move will be made twice.

Version 1.2 will implement a second difficulty and cosmetic improvements

-- due to the bad code quality (it was a first semester project) i stopped working on this project --
